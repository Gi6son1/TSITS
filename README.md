This game (The Shotgun In The Stone) will be a created using the libgdx engine and will be programmed using JAVA.

TO START:
1. Download project .zip into folder of your choice
2. Download git and learn how it works.
2. Use git to link up local folder location to online repo

   | Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.

   --> git init

   | Add files

   --> git add -all

   | Commit your changes

   --> git commit -m "First commit"

   | Add remote origin

   --> git remote add origin [Remote repository URL]

   [Remote repository URL] looks like: https://github.com/user/repo.git

   | Verifies the new remote URL

   --> git remote -v

   | Push your changes

   --> git push origin master

3. Once linked, you can now access online repo, pull other user's updates, push changes etc.
4. To open in intellij, you can choose to open the build.gradle file and select “Open as Project” to get started.
   --> There are different build.gradle files in different folders, you need to select the build file that is in the root directory (not in any sub-folder but in main directory).
